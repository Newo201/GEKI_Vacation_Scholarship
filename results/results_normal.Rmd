## The Model

We assume that we have access to a single observation from a multivariate normal distribution $y \sim N(\alpha x, \sigma^2I)$ where $\alpha$ is a scalar and $x$ is a known vector.

I look at three variations of this model

-   The variance is known, but the mean is not $\theta = \alpha$

-   The mean is known, but the variance is not $\theta = \sigma^2$

-   Both parameters are unknown $\theta = (\alpha, \sigma^2)$.

I look at a range of combinations of $\alpha, x$ and $\sigma^2$, comparing against MCMC sampling. Of particular interest is how well GEKI is able to estimate the noise parameter, since previous EKI algorithms require the noise parameter to be known.

### Priors

In all combinations we draw from the same priors (if that parameter is considered unknown):

-   $\alpha \sim ~ N(0, 5^2)$

-   $\log(\sigma^2) \sim N(2, 1^2)$

```{r}
prior_params <- list(alpha.mean = 0, alpha.sd = 5, 
                     sigma2.mean = 2, sigma2.sd = 1)
```

### Adaptive Tempering

```{r}
adaptive = FALSE
```

### Output

For each variation of the model, I plot the EKI histograms of the particles against their prior. In the known mean, unknown variance case, I also plot the posterior since there is an analytical posterior in this special case. This serves as a check that the algorithm has been implemented correctly.

## Changing Number of Dimensions

In this experiment I keep $\alpha$ and $\sigma^2$ fixed at 2 and 4 respectively and let $x$ be a vector of 1s corresponding to 10, 50 and 100 dimensions. I keep the number of particles fixed at 400. The purpose of this is to see how the EKI algorithm performs when the number of dimensions increases.

```{r}
num_dimensions <- c(10, 50, 100)
num_particles <- 400
for (dimension in num_dimensions) {
  true_parameters <- list(alpha = 2, sigma = 2, x = rep(1, dimension))
  generate_results(num_particles, true_parameters)
}
```

Overall, EKI covers both parameters quite well in this scenario. However, it is worth noting that the prior for $\sigma^2$ already covers the true parameter well and that the $\sigma^2$ particles have not shifted significantly from their prior distribution. By contrast MCMC concentrates well for both parameters and we can see a noticeable shift from the prior distribution.

## Changing $\alpha$

In this experiment, I keep $\sigma^2$ fixed at 4, make $x$ a 50-dimensional vector of 1s and change $\alpha$ from 0 to 10 in increments of 2. The purpose of this is to make sure that the EKI algorithm is accurate across of range of $\alpha$ and if it changes how the noise parameter is estimated.

```{r}
alpha_seq <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 6)
num_dimensions <- 50 
num_particles <- 400
for (alpha in alpha_seq) {    
  true_parameters <- list(alpha = alpha, sigma = 2, x = rep(1, num_dimensions))   
  generate_results(num_particles, true_parameters)
}
```

All EKI models and MCMC do well at estimating the mean parameter. There is no change in how the noise parameter is being estimated across a range of $\alpha$ values, which is not surprising since the covariance matrices used to update the particles should not depend on $\alpha$.

## Changing $\sigma^2$

In this experiment I change the true value of $\sigma$ from $2$ to $10$ in increments of $2$. The purpose of this is to determine whether the EKI algorithm can detect values of $\sigma$ which are further away from the prior. Additionally, we would expect the $\alpha$ particles to become more diffuse as the true value of $\sigma$ increases.

```{r}
sigma_seq <- seq(8, 10, length.out = 5)
num_dimensions <- 50
num_particles <- 400
for (sigma in sigma_seq) {

  true_parameters <- list(alpha = 2, sigma = sigma, x = rep(1, num_dimensions))
  generate_results(num_particles, true_parameters)
}
```

In the known variance case, the results for the mean parameter are what we expect. That is, the particles are centered around the true value and they become more diffuse as $\sigma^2$ increases. However, the ability of the other EKI models to estimate the true noise parameter is poor. Regardless of the true value of $\sigma^2$, the particles remain anchored to their prior distribution. In the cases where the prior is lower than the true value of $\sigma^2$, the $\alpha$ values become too concentrated. This is problematic if we don't have strong information about the noise parameter to specify a good prior distribution.

## Changing Number of Particles

Finally I change the number of particles used for the EKI algorithm. The main purpose of this is to check that the EKI model with known variance concentrates around the true posterior distribution.

```{r}
num_dimensions <- 50
particle_seq <- c(100, 500, 1000) 
true_parameters <- list(alpha = 2, sigma = 2, x = rep(1, num_dimensions))

for (num_particles in particle_seq) {
  generate_results(num_particles, true_parameters)
}
```

Indeed we find that this is the case.

## Conclusion

To summarize, GEKI does well at estimating the mean parameter, but does poorly at estimating the noise parameter, remaining anchored to its prior distribution. By contrast, MCMC does well at estimating both parameters. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the GEKI algorithm relies on a cross covariance between the parameters and the data, but $\sigma^2$ and $y$ are theoretically uncorrelated. See `results_covariances.md` for further detail.

While beyond the scope of this project, one would expect this phenomenon to be observed in similar parameters that affect variance and kurtosis only (e.g. the degrees of freedom in a t-distribution). Improvements to the algorithm which may be able to address this issue are also beyond the scope of this project.
